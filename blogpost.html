    <p class="font1">In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules to convert information—such
      as a letter, word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened or secret, for communication
      through a communication channel or storage in a storage medium. An early example is an invention of language,
      which enabled a person, through speech, to communicate what they thought, saw, heard, or felt to others. But
      speech limits the range of communication to the distance a voice can carry and limits the audience to those
      present when the speech is uttered. The invention of writing, which converted spoken language into visual symbols,
      extended the range of communication across space and time.

      The process of encoding converts information from a source into symbols for communication or storage. Decoding is
      the reverse process, converting code symbols back into a form that the recipient understands, such as English
      or/and Spanish.

      One reason for coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary plain language, spoken or written, is
      difficult or impossible. For example, semaphore, where the configuration of flags held by a signaler or the arms
      of a semaphore tower encodes parts of the message, typically individual letters, and numbers. Another person
      standing a great distance away can interpret the flags and reproduce the words sent.</p>
    <p class="font1">In content management systems, the terms frontend and backend may refer to the end-user facing
      views of the CMS and the administrative views, respectively.[1][2]

      In speech synthesis, the frontend refers to the part of the synthesis system that converts the input text into a
      symbolic phonetic representation, and the backend converts the symbolic phonetic representation into actual
      sounds.[3]

      In compilers, the frontend translates a computer programming source code into an intermediate representation, and
      the backend works with the intermediate representation to produce code in a computer output language. The backend
      usually optimizes to produce code that runs faster. The frontend/backend distinction can separate the parser
      section that deals with source code and the backend that generates code and optimizes. Some designs, such as GCC,
      offer choices between multiple frontends (parsing different source languages) or backends (generating code for
      different target processors).[4]

      Some graphical user interface (GUI) applications running in a desktop environment are implemented as a thin
      frontend for underlying command-line interface (CLI) programs, to save the user from learning the special
      terminology and memorizing the commands.</p>
    <p class="font1">A blog (a truncation of "weblog")[1] is an informational website consisting of discrete, often
      informal diary-style text entries (posts). Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order so that
      the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page. In the 2000s, blogs were often the work of a
      single individual, occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject or topic. In the 2010s,
      "multi-author blogs" (MABs) emerged, featuring the writing of multiple authors and sometimes professionally
      edited. MABs from newspapers, other media outlets, universities, think tanks, advocacy groups, and similar
      institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog traffic. The rise of Twitter and other "microblogging"
      systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs into the news media. Blog can also be used as a verb, meaning
      to maintain or add content to a blog.

      The emergence and growth of blogs in the late 1990s coincided with the advent of web publishing tools that
      facilitated the posting of content by non-technical users who did not have much experience with HTML or computer
      programming. Previously, knowledge of such technologies as HTML and File Transfer Protocol had been required to
      publish content on the Web, and early Web users therefore tended to be hackers and computer enthusiasts. As of the
      2010s, the majority are interactive Web 2.0 websites, allowing visitors to leave online comments, and it is this
      interactivity that distinguishes them from other static websites.[2] In that sense, blogging can be seen as a form
      of social networking service. Indeed, bloggers not only produce content to post on their blogs but also often
      build social relations with their readers and other bloggers.[3] Blog owners or authors often moderate and filter
      online comments to remove hate speech or other offensive content. There are also high-readership blogs which do
      not allow comments.

      Many blogs provide commentary on a particular subject or topic, ranging from philosophy, religion, and arts to
      science, politics, and sports. Others function as more personal online diaries or online brand advertising of a
      particular individual or company. A typical blog combines text, digital images, and links to other blogs, web
      pages, and other media related to its topic. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art (art
      blogs), photographs (photoblogs), videos (video blogs or vlogs), music (MP3 blogs), and audio (podcasts). In
      education, blogs can be used as instructional resources; these are referred to as edublogs. Microblogging is
      another type of blogging, featuring very short posts.

      Blog and blogging are now loosely used for content creation and sharing on social media, especially when the
      content is long-form and one creates and shares content on a regular basis, so one could be maintaining a blog on
      Facebook or blogging on Instagram. A 2022 estimate suggested that there were over 600 million public blogs out of
      more than 1.9 billion websites.[4]

      History
      Main articles: History of blogging and online diary

      An early example of a "diary" style blog consisting of text and images transmitted wirelessly in real-time from a
      wearable computer with head-up display, February 22, 1995
      The term "weblog" was coined by Jorn Barger[5] on December 17, 1997. The short form "blog" was coined by Peter
      Merholz, who jokingly broke the word weblog into the phrase we blog in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com in May
      1999.[6][7][8] Shortly thereafter, Evan Williams at Pyra Labs used "blog" as both a noun and verb ("to blog",
      meaning "to edit one's weblog or to post to one's weblog") and devised the term "blogger" in connection with Pyra
      Labs' Blogger product, leading to the popularization of the terms.[9]

      Origins
      Before blogging became popular, digital communities took many forms, including Usenet, commercial online services
      such as GEnie, Byte Information Exchange (BIX) and the early CompuServe, e-mail lists,[10] and Bulletin Board
      Systems (BBS). In the 1990s, Internet forum software created running conversations with "threads". Threads are
      topical connections between messages on a virtual "corkboard".[further explanation needed]

      Berners-Lee also created what is considered by Encyclopedia Britannica to be "the first 'blog'" in 1992 to discuss
      the progress made on creating the World Wide Web and software used for it.[11]

      From June 14, 1993, Mosaic Communications Corporation maintained their "What's New"[12] list of new websites,
      updated daily and archived monthly. The page was accessible by a special "What's New" button in the Mosaic web
      browser. </p>
    <p class="font1">Pyton was a Norwegian comic book series which was produced by the company Gevion, and afterwards
      Bladkompaniet, between the years 1986 until 1996. An anthology magazine with no major main character, its style of
      humor focused mostly on satiric and toilet humour, including sexual, toilet, and farting jokes. Most of Pyton's
      material was produced by the magazine's own staff, but a handful of foreign comics also appeared in the magazine,
      including Gary Larson's The Far Side, and the German comic Werner.

      The name is Norwegian for python, a term which in Scandinavia also has gained a slang adjective meaning of
      "disgusting" or "sick". The magazine also adopted a python snake as mascot (after discarding their original polar
      bear), who occasionally featured in his own comics.

      The magazine reached its peak around 1990 when it sold around 35,000 copies per month.

      The Essential Guide to World Comics by Tim Pilcher and Brad Brooks says that the anthology and its sister series
      MegaPyton had "short-lived but important MAD-style humour anthologies with an underground comix edge."[1]

      The magazine's editor was Dag Kolstad, who prior had been the editor for Norsk MAD, the Norwegian edition of MAD
      Magazine. Kolstad was also a writer for many of the series (under the pen name Dick Kolby), and was also featured
      in the actual series as the sadistic and overweight character Redaktøren (The Editor). Another prominent writer
      was Rolf Håndstad (pen name: Rhesus Minus, Balle Brock).

      Some of Pyton's most prominent artists were Tommy Sydsæter, Bjørn Ousland, Arild Midthun (pen name: Arnold
      Milten), Kristian B. Walters and Frode Øverli who a few years later created the successful and popular comic strip
      Pondus. Martin Kellerman, who later went on to create Rocky, also made a few contributions to Pyton in the
      mid-1990s.

      In 2009, the old magazine had gained a large nostalgic appeal, and it was decided to launch the massive collector
      box MegaPyton (not to be confused with the Swedish magazine Mega-Pyton, see below), featuring classics from the
      magazine collected in hardcover books.</p>
